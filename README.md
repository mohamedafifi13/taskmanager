# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Introduction

The Task Manager application is a web-based task management tool developed using the React framework. It offers users a convenient platform to organize their tasks efficiently.

### Features

- Authentication

  : Utilizing Firebase authentication, the application ensures secure access for users. A predefined user account is available for testing purposes, with the following credentials:

  - Email: `a@a.com`
  - Password: `12345678`Users also have the option to sign up with their own credentials for personalized access.

- **Task Management**: Tasks are stored locally, providing users with seamless access to their task lists across sessions. Users can add, edit, and remove tasks as needed, facilitating effective task management.

### Deployment

The application is deployed using Netlify, ensuring accessibility and reliability for users. The deployment process ensures that the application is readily available for use, offering a smooth user experience.

### Getting Started

To begin using the Task Manager application, follow these steps:

1. Access the application using the provided URL or deploy it locally.
2. Sign in using the provided credentials or register with your own account.
3. Start managing your tasks efficiently, utilizing the intuitive interface and features offered by the application.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
